# A11Y Project
The Accessibility Project is a community&ndash;driven effort to make web accessibility easier. We attempt to make *#A11Y* tips and tricks easier to digest and leveraging a community of developer knowledge.

Our goal is to accomplish this with 3 tenets in mind:

1. **Digestible.** Articles on accessibility tend to be in-depth. We feature short, digestible pieces of content.
2. **Up-to-date.** The project is hosted on Github so information can be current with the latest standards.
3. **Forgiving.** People make mistakes and web accessibility is hard, so we seek to be encouraging.

## Contributing
Everything you need to know about contributing to this project can be found in our [Contributor Docs](https://github.com/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Requirements
In order to contribute to the website&rsquo;s codebase, you&rsquo;ll need to know a bit about [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) [Sass](http://sass-lang.com), [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and some Command Line-fu. You'll also need to know how to install *[Ruby Gems](https://rvm.io)* and of course have *[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)* installed on your machine.

### Gem Installation
Use the ``bundle`` command to install the necessary gems for the **A11Y Project**. If you don't have [bundler](http://gembundler.com) installed you'll need to run ``gem install bundler`` before using ``bundle``.

    $ bundle install

## Local Development
Trigger the local server by executing the ``jekyll serve`` task.

    $ jekyll serve

Your local copy will now be accessible at `http://localhost:4000`. Then use `CTRL` + `C` to stop the server. :)
