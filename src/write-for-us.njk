		The A11Y Project is community-built, and we'd love it if you'd become a member. One way you can do this is through writing. And guess what? <strong>We pay</strong>!
	</p>
	<h2 id="what-kinds-of-writing-do-we-publish" class="c-heading-large">
		What kinds of writing do we publish?
	</h2>
	<p>
		The A11Y Project features seven main kinds of published content:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Backgrounds</strong> contain general information for help in thinking about different parts of digital accessibility.</li>
		<li><strong>Myths</strong> are short pieces that debunk common misconceptions and falsehoods about accessibility. </li>
		<li><strong>Quick tests</strong> outline a short collection of steps needed to check your content to determine if it is accessible.</li>
		<li><strong>Quick tips</strong> provide short, easy-to-digest and easy-to-implement accessibility-related information.</li>
		<li><strong>Assistive technology</strong> provides background information on the tools used by people who rely on them to navigate digital devices and interfaces.</li>
		<li><strong>How-tos</strong> are guides to implementing accessible code.</li>
		<li><strong>Experiences</strong> are people discussing their access needs, and why accessibility is important to them.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		We're also open to ideas for new kinds of content and features!
	</p>
	<h2 id="our-audience" class="c-heading-large">
		Our audience

	<p>
		Our readers run the range from people who are completely new to the concept of accessibility to experienced practitioners who work full-time in the industry.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our content is written for people new to digital accessibility. Because of this, we strive to keep our content short, easy to understand, and to the point. This serves everyoneâ€”sometimes people who have been doing accessibility work for a long time can benefit from a refresher!
	</p>
