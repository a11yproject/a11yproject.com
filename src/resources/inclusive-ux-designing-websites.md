## What were your goals in making this course?

My goals for the course included why inclusive design benefits everyone, provide students with tools and resources for inclusive design and things to consider while conducting user research and testing.

## What is one important thing someone taking your course will learn?

Students in the course will learn about web accessibility and inclusive design, from a User Experience perspective.

## Is there any other info you'd like to share about it, or your experience doing accessibility work?
