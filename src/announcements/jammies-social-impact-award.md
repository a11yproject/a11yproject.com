The A11Y Project was awarded a [Jammy for Social Impact Award](https://jamstackconf.com/jammies/), an award given “for utilizing Jamstack technologies for the delivery of valuable and important resources, in service of the community and for the betterment of society.”

If you are unfamiliar with the term [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/what-is-jamstack/), it is a way to build websites that prioritizes speed, performance, and security. It does this by letting servers do the bulk of the work before the website or web app is sent to the device requesting it.

When redesigning, keeping a Jamstack approach was of the utmost importance. Jamstack websites are more approachable, more accessible, and more performance-conscious. These qualities are vital for creating inclusive experiences on the web.

We would also like to thank [Zach Leatherman and the Eleventy team](https://www.11ty.dev/) for creating a static site generator that was [a perfect fit for our needs when redesigning](https://www.a11yproject.com/announcements/redesign/#eleventy).

Our deepest gratitude is extended to [the Jamstack conference](https://jamstackconf.com/) team and community, as well as our contributors and our maintainers. Your support makes this effort possible.

Here’s to a more accessible, inclusive internet!
