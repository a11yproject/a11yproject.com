Permanent accessibility overlay products such as [accessiBe](https://accessibe.com/) and [AudioEye](https://www.audioeye.com/) are actively harmful, and a step backwards for digital accessibility efforts.

The A11Y Project does not recommend using them, and encourages websites and web apps that currently have them installed to remove them. Read more about the nuance behind this decision in our post, [Should I use an accessibility overlay?](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/should-i-use-an-accessibility-overlay/)
