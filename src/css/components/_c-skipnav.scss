// Skipnav
//
// A skipnav, sometimes known as a jumpnav, allows someone to skip sections of
// content that are repeated from page to page. An example of this is skipping
// the main navigation that is repeated on every page of this site.
//
// Skipnav is useful to people who use screen readers, as it allows them to
// quickly get to the main point of the page. It is also useful to people with
// motor control disabilities, as it lessens the amount of effort it takes to
// navigate.
//
// A skipnav that links to the main content of the page should typically be the
// first thing you put in the code for your page templates. For The A11Y
// Project, it is the first piece of code used after the opening `body` element.
//
// Markup:
// <a class="c-skipnav" href="#title">Skip to content.</a>
//
// Style guide: Components.skipnav
