// Animation Easing
//
// Controls how animations accelerate and decelerate. The easing terms
// communicate how elements on the page relate to each other.
//
// Make sure that your animations don't flash, strobe, or have too great a
// contrast between the static elements they are placed next to, so as to not
// be a trigger for conditions such as vertigo and ADHD. You may also want to
// use a [`prefers-reduced-motion` media query](https://css-tricks.com/introduction-reduced-motion-media-query/)
// for people who have expressed a desire for less animation.
