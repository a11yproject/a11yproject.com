Can automated tools guarantee full compliance with accessibility standards like WCAG? The short answer is <strong>no</strong>. While automated accessibility tools are often marketed as comprehensive solutions, they are only part of the equation.


## What automated tools can do

Automated tools are good at detecting straightforward accessibility issues, such as missing alt text, poor color contrast, and incorrect heading structures. Tools like [WebYes](https://www.webyes.com/) and [axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/) are examples of automated tools that efficiently flag these issues.

The speed and efficiency of automated accessibility tools make them ideal for initial audits. They can scan hundreds of web pages in minutes, pinpointing the most straightforward problems—what we often call “low-hanging fruit.”

The results of the initial audit provide a strong foundation, allowing teams to prioritize critical fixes and plan for deeper manual testing to address more complex accessibility issues.


## What automated tools miss

While automated tools are excellent for identifying straightforward issues, they cannot evaluate issues that require human judgment, such as:

- Whether alternative text for images is meaningful.
- The logical flow and usability of keyboard navigation.
- The clarity of instructions or error messages for forms.

When human judgment is missing, important accessibility issues can go unnoticed, making the experience difficult and frustrating for users with disabilities. This can prevent them from fully accessing or using the website as intended.

Studies highlight this gap. A [Government Digital Service (<abbr>GDS</abbr> audit](https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-tool-audit/) revealed that even the best automated tools detect only 30-40% of known accessibility issues. Accessibility expert [Karl Groves notes](https://karlgroves.com/web-accessibility-testing-what-can-be-tested-and-how/) that only 25 to 33% of WCAG guidelines can be reliably tested with automation.


## Striking the right balance

The most effective approach combines automation with manual efforts. Automated scans identify technical issues, while manual reviews and usability tests uncover the subtle barriers tools miss.

By incorporating user feedback and providing your team with ongoing accessibility training, you can ensure compliance becomes an integral part of your development process—not just an afterthought.


## Conclusion

Automated tools are essential for modern accessibility workflows, but they are not a complete solution. True compliance requires the precision of human judgment alongside the speed of automation. Together, they can create digital spaces that meet legal requirements and, more importantly, serve the diverse needs of all users.
