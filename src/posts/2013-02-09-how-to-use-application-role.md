**Never** use `role="application"` on a widely containing element such as `<body>` if your page consists mostly of traditional widgets or page elements such as links that the user does not have to interact with in focus mode. 

Using `role="application"` unnecessarily can cause huge headaches for any assistive technology user trying to use your site/application. Only put it on the `<body>` element if your page consists solely of a widget or set of widgets that all need the focus mode[^focusmode] to be turned on.


## Do

1. Use sparingly.
1. If your page has no resemblance to a classic document in roughly over 90% of its content.
1. Use clear labels within your application.


## Don't

1. If a set of controls or user interface only contains these widgets that are all part of standard HTML[^html]
1. If your widget is dynamic such as a tree view, slider or table.

Unless you take a great deal of care in ensuring that you&rsquo;ve recreated a lot of native&ndash;ish custom navigation, it&rsquo;s almost always better to let the browser/assistive technology handle things. We only recommend using <code>role='application'</code> on a per&ndash;widget basis, and even then: very, very carefully.

[^focusmode]: Allows the user to interact with forms and ARIA&ndash;enabled HTML elements.
[^html]: Standard HTML refers to: text, password, search, tel and other newer input type derivates, `textarea`, `checkbox`, `button`, radio button (usually inside a `fieldset`/`legend` element wrapper), `select` &amp; `option`(s), links, paragraphs, headings, and other things that are classic/native to documents on the web.
