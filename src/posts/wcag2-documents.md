The [**Web Content Accessibility Guidelines**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (<abbr>WCAG</abbr>) are web accessibility guidelines published by the [**Web Accessibility Initiative**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/) (<abbr>WAI</abbr>).

The WCAG's goal is to provide a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations and governments internationally. Over time, WCAG has produced various versions of the [**Web Content Accessibility Guidelines**](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). WCAG 2.0 was published on 11 December 2008, WCAG 2.1 was published on 5 June 2018. WCAG 2.2 is a W3C working draft as of 5 June 2020.


## WCAG 2.x

WCAG 2.x consists of 12 guidelines. It is organized around four principles which form the acronym "POUR". They include, but are not limited to:

### 1. Content must be Perceivable (P).

- Provide a text alternative for all non-text content.
- Provide synchronized alternatives for multimedia (such as captioned video, audio descriptions etc).
- Information and structure must be separate from presentation.
- Make it easy to distinguish foreground information from the background (for example: good color contrast).

### 2. Interfaces must be Operable (O).

- All functionality must be operable via keyboard.
- Provide users enough time to read and use content.
- Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.
- Provide mechanisms for users to find content, orientate themselves and navigate through it.

### 3. Content and controls must be Understandable (U).

- Make text content readable and understandable.
- Make the placement and functionality of content predictable.
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes.

### 4. Content must be Robust (R).

- Support compatibility with current and future user agents.

## Layers of guidance

The WCAG provides various ways to help authors meet its standard called ["layers of guidance"](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#wcag-2-layers-of-guidance). They include the following :

- [Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#text-alternatives).
- [Success criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded).
- [Techniques](hhttps://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques).
- [Common failures](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques#failures).


## Guidelines

WCAG 2.x guidelines are categorized into [3 levels of conformance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#levels) in order to meet the needs of different groups and situations. Under each principle, there is a [list of guidelines](https://w3c.github.io/wcag/21/guidelines/) that addresses the principles.


## Success criteria

Under each guideline, there are success criteria that describe specifically what is to be done in order to conform to the standard.  Each success criteria is written as a statement that will be either true or false when specific web content is tested against it.  A convenient [list of the success criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) is also provided.


## Techniques

The techniques document provides guidance for web authors and evaluators on meeting WCAG 2.1 success criteria. A convenient [list of the WCAG 2.1 techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/) can be found here.


## Common failures

These are common mistakes that are considered failures of Success Criteria of WCAG 2.x. A [comprehensive list of  WCAG 2.x common failures](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/failures) is also provided.


## What's new?

WCAG 2.1 is the current standard. It was initiated with the aim of improving accessibility guidance for three major groups:

- People with cognitive or learning disabilities,
- People with low vision, and
- People with disabilities on mobile devices.

There are additional success criteria in WCAG 2.1 that are not in WCAG 2.0. They are introduced in [Whatâ€™s New in WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/). For a detailed  review of WCAG 2.1 , see [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

<blockquote>
	<p>While WCAG 2.0 remains a W3C recommendation, the W3C advises the use of WCAG 2.1 in order to maximize future applicability of accessibility efforts.</p>
	<footer>
		<cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#abstract/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 - W3C</a></cite>
	</footer>
</blockquote>

In effect, the  publication of WCAG 2.1 does not nullify WCAG 2.0 as content that conforms to WCAG 2.0 also conforms to WCAG 2.1.


## Summary

The following are important points to remember:

- WCAG is a set of accessibility guidelines published by WAI.
- WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 are stable, referenceable technical standards.
- They have 12-13 guidelines that are organized under 4 principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.
- Content that conforms to WCAG 2.0  is also compatible with  WCAG 2.1.
