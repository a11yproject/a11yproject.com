I believe in information integrity and accessibility for all through inclusive design principles. I started out as a frontend web developer and through learning about web standards found a passion for accessibility. As an accessibility engineer, I enjoy helping teams prevent accessibility problems by designing for people not like themselves while using semantic markup.
