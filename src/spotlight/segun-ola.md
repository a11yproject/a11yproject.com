I’m a frontend web developer working with Andela Nigeria. I work with Andela partners to build highly interactive and accessible web applications.

Learning about accessibility has given me greater perspective to my job. I am in the business of User Experience, not just visual appearance. The reason we make software is so people, not some people, can have easy access to the information they need and do the things they care about.

Learning about accessibility has opened my eyes to how much disability is interwoven with the human experience. It seems hypocritical to not actively account for that.

Accessibility is the work. The reason we build software is to give the world access to whatever product, service or solution we’ve come up with. Just like all things in software engineering, it’ll probably never be perfect at first but it should be done.
