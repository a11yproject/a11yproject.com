		The A11Y Project is committed to creating and maintaining an accessible, inclusive environment. It is a resource that is intended to be able to be used by everyone. This includes our audience, and also our <a href="{{ '/team/' | url }}">contributors</a>.
	</p>
	<h2 id="the-standard-we-adhere-to" class="c-heading-large">
		The standard we adhere to
	</h2>
	<p>
		The A11Y Project strives to be <strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (<abbr>WCAG</abbr>)</a> AA compliant</strong>. The WCAG is an open standard for determining accessibility. AA compliance is considered good support for a website geared towards a global audience.
	</p>
	<h2 id="what-we-are-doing" class="c-heading-large">
		What we are doing
	</h2>
	<p>
		The following initiatives are how The A11Y Project goes about doing this. We are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Guided by a <a href="{{ '/code-of-conduct/' | url }}">Code of Conduct</a> that outlines expected behaviors.</li>
		<li>Capable of responding to Code of Conduct breaches, should they occur, via an incident response guide.</li>
		<li>Using time-tested, stable and interoperable technology based on <a href="#technical-specifications">open standards</a> to help ensure our content can be accessed by the widest range of devices as possible.</li>
		<li>Running automated and manual checks to test for accessibility issues.</li>
		<li>Working with daily assistive technology users to help verify our content works as intended.</li>
		<li><a href="https://twitter.com/A11YProject">Promoting and attributing resources and knowledge</a> about digital accessibility.</li>
		<li>Providing a free <a href="{{ '/checklist/' | url }}">checklist</a> to help others audit their content for accessibility issues.</li>
		<li>Using <a href="{{ '/content-style-guide/' | url }}">clear, person-first, non-abelist language</a> for our messaging.</li>
		<li>Hosting our code on <a href="https://github.com/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/">a public repository</a>, allowing anyone with the interest and capability to inspect and modify it.</li>
		<li>Striving to keep our interactions and user interface unambiguous and easy to understand.</li>
		<li>Striving to keep our download size small and memory footprint light.</li>
		<li>Supporting magnified and zoomed displays, as well as custom typefaces and themes potentially set by someone in their browser.</li>
		<li>Maintaining a color palette with high contrast ratios values to keep content legible.</li>
		<li>Using distinct, obvious focus states for all interactive elements.</li>
		<li>Respecting expressed preferences for a reduced animation experience.</li>
		<li>Providing open, structured guidance on <a href="{{ '/contributing-guidelines/' | url }}">how to contribute</a>, with provisions for individuals who may be unwilling or unable to use our preferred workflows.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="accessibility-features" class="c-heading-medium">
		Accessibility features
	</h3>
	<p>
		In addition to semantic HTML, these features are set up specifically to work with assistive technology:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Distinct, descriptive page titles.</li>
		<li>Ordered headings to construct a logical document flow.</li>
		<li><a href="{{ '/posts/2013-01-14-aria-landmark-roles/' | url }}">Landmark areas</a> to describe overall sections of the page.</li>
		<li>Unique, descriptive names for links, buttons, and other interactive controls.
		<li><a href="{{ '/posts/2013-05-11-skip-nav-links/' | url }}">Skiplinks</a> have been placed to help people navigate past content that repeats from page to page.</li>
		<li><a href="{{ '/posts/2013-01-14-alt-text/' | url }}">Alternative descriptions</a> for non-text content.</li>
		<li>Titles for content embedded via <code>iframe</code> elements.</li>
		<li>Removing repetive, redundant links to the same destination from the Accessibility Tree.</li>
		<li>Small amounts of ARIA to help address gaps in assistive technology support.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="technical-specifications" class="c-heading-medium">
		Technical specifications
	</h3>
	<p>
		We rely on the following technologies to work with the particular combination of web browser and any assistive technologies or plugins installed on your computer:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">HTML</a>.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/">ARIA</a>.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a>.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/script.html">JavaScript</a>.</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/">SVG</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		These technologies are relied upon for conformance with the accessibility standards used.
