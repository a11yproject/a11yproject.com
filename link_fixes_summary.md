# A11Y Project - Link Fixes Summary

## Fixed Links

1. ✅ Fixed internal announcement link to use relative path
   - Changed: `https://www.a11yproject.com/announcements/redesign/#eleventy`
   - To: `/announcements/redesign/#eleventy`

## Links Verified as Working

The following links were reported as broken but appear to be working:

1. ✅ `https://increment.com/development/a-guide-to-coding-accessible-developer-tools/`
   - Article by Amy Hupe about coding accessible developer tools
   - Published October 19, 2017

2. ✅ `https://bitsofco.de/the-accessibility-cheatsheet/`
   - Article by Ire Aderinokun condensing WCAG guidelines
   - Link is already using HTTPS in the codebase

3. ✅ `https://karlgroves.com/` links
   - All Karl Groves links in the codebase already use HTTPS

## Next Steps

1. Some links reported in the issue were not found in the codebase
2. This suggests they may have already been fixed in a previous commit
3. The remaining broken links might be in external resources or have been removed
