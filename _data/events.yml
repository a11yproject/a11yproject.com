      description: "Laura gets really tired of the myth that accessible websites are ugly websites. First of all, accessibility starts with our content, and Laura will explore ways to make content more inclusive. Then, let’s look at inclusive aesthetics, and how layout, typography and color can be used to improve a site’s accessibility while also making for an attractive page. We’ll prove them wrong!"
