title: Accessibility is hard :(
---

For many web developers, accessibility is complex and somewhat difficult. SimpleA11Y understands that and we want to help to make web accessibility easier for front end developers to implement. Our strategy is to accomplish this with 3 principles in mind:

1. **Digestible.** We strive to feature short, digestible pieces of content.
1. **Up-to-date.** The project is hosted on Github so information can be current with the latest standards.
1. **Forgiving.** People make mistakes and web accessiblity is hard, so we seek to be encouraging.

If you care and are knowledgeable about accessibility and want to help please consider [contributing](https://github.com/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md). We would love people to help write articles, edit inaccuracies, and provide top-level information.

### About this site

This site is built with [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and built collaboratively by developers (see the footer) on [Github](https://github.com/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/). In its current state, SimpleA11Y may not be a perfect example of an accessible website&hellip; yet. We're commited, through the power of Open Source, to incrementally improve our own accessibility on the site going forward.
