title: Accessibility is hard :(
---

This site is the product of a community of people who want to help to make web accessibility... well, accessible. Our goal is to accomplish this with 3 tennets in mind:

1. **Digestible.** Articles on accessibilty tend to be in-depth. We feature short, digestible pieces of content.
1. **Up-to-date.** The project is hosted on Github so information can be current with the latest standards.
1. **Forgiving.** People make mistakes and web accessiblity is hard, so we seek to be encouraging.
