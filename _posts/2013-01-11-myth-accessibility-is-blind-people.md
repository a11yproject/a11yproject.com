Accessibility is often viewed as making your site work on screen readers. In reality, web accessibility is a subset of <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> focused on making your websites usable by the widest range of people possible, including those who have disabilities.

### Four Categories of Accessibilitiy

Accessibility can be broken down into four key categories[^fn1].

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>&nbsp;</th>
        <th>Associated&nbsp;Conditions</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>
          <h4>Visual</h4>
          This can be non-sighted users, users with low-vision, users with obstructed vision, or even simply your aging parents.</td>
        <td>
          <ul>
            <li>Myopia</li>
            <li>Colour blindness</li>
            <li>Glaucoma</li>
            <li>Albinism</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
          <h4>Auditory</h4>
          The web is a visual medium, but captions and fallbacks for sound-necessary media need to be considered for hearing impaired users.</td>
        <td>
          <ul>
            <li>Presbycusis</li>
            <li>Acoustic trauma</li>
            <li>Auditory processing disorder</li>
            <li>Otosclerosis</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
          <h4>Motor</h4>
          People with motor impairments typically use a wide range of assistive technology from specialized keyboards, to eye trackers, to using single buttons to navigate their computer.</td>
        <td>
          <ul>
            <li>RSI</li>
            <li>Cerebral palsy</li>
            <li>Parkinson's</li>
            <li>Muscular dystrophy</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
          <h4>Cognitive</h4>
          Relates to the ease processing of information.</td>
        <td>
          <ul>
            <li>Downâ€™s syndrome</li>
            <li>Autism</li>
            <li>Global developmental delay</li>
            <li>Dyslexia</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

As you can see, there are a variety of different users with different needs and concerns across the web. We will cover each category further in detail as they relate to accessibility on the web.
