**NEVER** use `role="application"` on a widely containing element such as `<body>` if your page consists mostly of traditional widgets or page elements such as links that the user does not have to interact with in focus mode. Using `role="application"` unnecessarily can cause huge headaches for any assistive technology user trying to use your site/application. Only put it on the `<body>` element if your page consists solely of a widget or set of widgets that all need the focus mode[^focusmode] to be turned on.

**Do**

1. Use sparingly.
2. If your page has no resemblance to a classic document in roughly over 90% of its content.
3. Use clear labels within your application.

**Don&rsquo;t**

1. If a set of controls or user interface only contains these widgets that are all part of standard <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>[^html]
2. If your widget is dynamic such as a tree view, slider or table.

Unless you take a great deal of care in ensuring that you&rsquo;ve recreated a lot of native&ndash;ish custom navigation, it&rsquo;s almost always better to leave the browser/<abbr title="Assistive Technologies">AT</abbr> to its own devices. We really only recommend it on a per&ndash;in&ndash;page&ndash;widget basis, and even then: very, very carefully.
