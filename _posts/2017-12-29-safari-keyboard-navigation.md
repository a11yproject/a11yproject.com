In order to allow for full keyboard navigation of all element in Safari on macOS, make sure the following options are enabled.

## All Controls in macOS

In the macOS settings, allow **"All Controls"** to be keyboard accessible.  Enable this feature by going to:

1. Settings
2. Keyboard
3. Shortcuts (tab)
4. Select "All controls" (radio button)
