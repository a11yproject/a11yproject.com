One quick way that you can check your accessibility is to navigate through the site using nothing but your keyboard.

1. Un-plug/turn off your mouse.
2. Use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key browse.
3. Use <kbd>Enter</kbd> to select elements.
4. Some menus and form elements may require <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> <kbd>&darr;</kbd> <kbd>&larr;</kbd> <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> arrow keys.

This is by no means a complete accessibility check, but it can quickly help you find major accessibility problems.
