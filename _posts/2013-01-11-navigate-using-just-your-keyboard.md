Testing your site for keyboard navigation will help ensure that keyboard users can access your site.

As a bonus, sites that can be navigated with a keyboard are more likely to be navigable with other input devices such as switches.

## How to navigate a website with a keyboard
Generally, pressing <kbd>tab</kbd> moves focus between interactive elements and pressing <kbd>enter</kbd> will interact with them.

If you are using Safari, <kbd>option-tab</kbd> is the default keyboard shortcut to move focus between elements. You can update your settings to make <kbd>tab</kbd> the default navigation key by following the instructions in this article: [Quick Tip: Safari Keyboard Navigation](https://a11yproject.com/posts/safari-keyboard-navigation/)

Additional keyboard shortcuts are described here: [WebAIM - Keyboard Accessibility](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/)

## Things to keep in mind while testing
It is not enough to simply tab through a webpage from start to end. While navigating the site, keep these things in mind:
- Interactive elements should be functional using only keyboard input.
- The focused element should be visible and have an obvious focus style. See article: ["Quick Tip: Never remove CSS outlines"](https://a11yproject.com/posts/never-remove-css-outlines/).
- Focus should move between elements as they appear on the page and not jump back and forth.
- There should be a way to skip past lengthy spans of content, like global navigation menus. See article: ["Howâ€“to: Use Skip Navigation links"](https://a11yproject.com/posts/skip-nav-links/).
