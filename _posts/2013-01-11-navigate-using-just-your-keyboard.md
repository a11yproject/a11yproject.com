### Introduction
Testing your site for keyboard navigation will ensure that keyboard users can access your site.

As a bonus, sites that can be navigated with a keyboard can also likely be navigated using other input devices.

### How to navigate a website with a keyboard
Generally, pressing `tab` moves focus between elements and pressing `enter` will interact with them.

If you are using Safari, `option-tab` is the default keyboard shortcut to move focus between elements. You can update your settings to make `tab` the default navigation key by following the instructions in this article: [Quick Tip: Safari Keyboard Navigation](https://a11yproject.com/posts/safari-keyboard-navigation/)

Additional keyboard shortcuts are described here: [WebAIM - Keyboard Accessibility](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/)

### Things to keep in mind while testing
It is not enough to simply tab through a webpage from start to end. While navigating the site, keep these things in mind:
- Interactive elements should be functional using only keyboard shortcuts.
- The focused element should be visible and have an obvious focus style. See article: ["Quick Tip: Never remove CSS outlines"](https://a11yproject.com/posts/never-remove-css-outlines/).
- Focus should move between elements as they appear on the page and not jump back and forth.
- There should be a way to skip past lengthy navigation items. See article: ["Howâ€“to: Use Skip Navigation links"](https://a11yproject.com/posts/skip-nav-links/).
