Developers commonly use `display: none` to hide content on the page. Unfortunately, this simple and common action is a bit problematic for screen readers.

[Screen readers sometimes ignore display:none](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200711/screen_readers_sometimes_ignore_displaynone/). Which means the content will be read despite being "hidden". To hide content completely from screen readers use the following:

    /* http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200711/screen_readers_sometimes_ignore_displaynone/ */
    .hidden {
        display:none;
        visibility:hidden;
    }

And for good measure you could consider adding the ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"` to the element.

There are also real world situations where you want to hide elements (i.e., a `form label`), but you still want text to be read by a screen reader.

    /* http://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/ */
    .screen-reader-text {
        position:absolute;
        left:-10000px;
        top:auto;
        width:1px;
        height:1px;
        overflow:hidden;
    }

Consider adding these HTML classes and CSS rules to your base stylesheet and use them when applicable.
