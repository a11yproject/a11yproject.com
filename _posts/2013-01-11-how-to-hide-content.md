Developers commonly use `display: none` to hide content on the page. Unfortunately, this simple and common action is a bit problematic for screen readers.

[Screen readers sometimes ignore display:none](http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200711/screen_readers_sometimes_ignore_displaynone/). This means the content will be read despite being "hidden". To hide content completely from screen readers use the following:

    /* http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200711/screen_readers_sometimes_ignore_displaynone/ */
    .hidden {
        display:none;
        visibility:hidden;
    }

And for good measure you could consider adding the ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"` to the element.

There are also real world situations where you want to hide elements (e.g., a `form label`), but you still want text to be read by a screen reader.

The clip pattern will hide the content visually, yet provide the content to screen readers. Unlike positioning and negative text-indent, it works with rtl languages for localization.
Read Thierry Koblentz's article [Clip Your Hidden Content For Better Accessibility](http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2012/10/clip-your-hidden-content-for-better-accessibility/) for more information on this pattern and when to decide between visually-hidden and hidden.
    .visually-hidden { /*http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2012/10/clip-your-hidden-content-for-better-accessibility/*/
        position: absolute !important;
        clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px); /* IE6, IE7 */
        clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
        padding:0 !important;
        border:0 !important;
        height: 1px !important;
        width: 1px !important;
        overflow: hidden;
        } body:hover .visually-hidden a, body:hover .visually-hidden input, body:hover .visually-hidden button { display: none !important; } 

Consider adding these HTML classes and CSS rules to your base stylesheet and use them when applicable.
