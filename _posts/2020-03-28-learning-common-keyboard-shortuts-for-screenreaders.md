Keyboard shortcuts are often presented to us in a list or a table. Lists and tables are great for some people, while others may be overwhelmed from the sheer number of commands to learn. Sometimes a more visual approach could help us learn.

## Learning visually helps
Creating a mind map of keyboard shortcuts can help learn those shortcuts easier than lists and tables. 

Here's a mind map of the common keyboard shortcuts in popular screen readers: ![Mind map of common keyboard shortcuts for screen readers](/img/posts/2020-03-28-learning-common-keyboard-shortuts-for-screenreader/common-keyboard-shortcuts-mindmap.png.png)

That mind map shows some shortcuts across screen readers by tasks but is not exhaustive. An example of one task is to 'list all landmarks'. This task then branches off into JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver iOS, TalkBack and Narrator screen readers. Each then branches into their own shortcut:
- List all landmarks -> JAWS -> R or ;
- List all landmarks -> NVDA -> D
- List all landmarks -> Narrator -> D
- List all landmarks -> VoiceOver iOS -> Two finger twist (the rotor menu)
- List all landmarks -> TalkBack -> Swipe right (the local context menu)

The shortcuts are taken from (Deque on shortcuts and gestures)[https://dequeuniversity.com/screenreaders/].

## Found a cool shortcut? Look it up
Other great ways of learning is to try out some shortcut that you thought were exciting. The TalkBack and VoiceOver mobile shortcuts are quite fun to try out.

Looking up videos on how to do those shortcuts. Seeing the shortcut being acted out will help that information sink in.

Trying it out yourself on a device is even better. Android devices have TalkBack, iOS and MacOS have VoiceOver and Microsoft has Narrator.

In an ideal world we would be using common screen readers daily to help us learn through experience. While these learning techniques can be helpful, they may not be right for everyone. Learn the way that works bests for you.
