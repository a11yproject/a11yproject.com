There are a few things you can do if you are running into difficulty working with the website:

1. Re-read the [Development](https://github.com/a11yproject/a11yproject.com#development) section of our [README](https://github.com/a11yproject/a11yproject.com).
1. Read our [TROUBLESHOOTING](https://github.com/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) and [TECHNOLOGY](https://github.com/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/blob/main/TECHNOLOGY.md) documentation.
1. [Create an Issue](https://github.com/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/issues/new?template=a11yproject-com-bug-report.md) on [our Issue tracker](https://github.com/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/issues).
1. Send us a message via [our contact form](https://www.a11yproject.com/contact/).

We will try to respond in a reasonable amount of time for all issues and messages.
